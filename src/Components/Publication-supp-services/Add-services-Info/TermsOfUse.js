                     <h3>Governing law/dispute resolution </h3>
                     <p>By using the Site, you agree to resolve any disputes between you and us by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in a court of law. This means that any dispute you have with us will be resolved through a process in which one party (you, typically) participates in private arbitration proceedings with another party (usually us), who serves as the arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted by a retired judge or retired arbitrator who is familiar with commercial disputes. If you reside in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, we will pay all costs of the arbitration, including attorneys' fees. If you reside outside of these three countries, we will pay all costs of the arbitration, but you will be responsible for all fees associated with the arbitration. We agree to notify you of the date, time, and place of each arbitration proceeding. You may also obtain copies of these documents from us by writing to us at the address listed below. </p>
					  <p>If you elect to have your dispute resolved by arbitration instead of court, you and we both agree that any such dispute shall be governed by and construed by the laws of the Indian Country, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law rules that would cause the application of the laws of a different state or country. </p>
